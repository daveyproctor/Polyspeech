My no vote today reflected my commitment to them that I will never support amnesty. The bill included some good things but went too far in granting amnesty for about 2M people who came into this country illegally -- I have full confidence that President Trump will select a strong, constitutional conservative to fill the upcoming Supreme Court vacancy. I\\'m looking forward to seeing who he picks! #LA05 -- On #PTSDAwarenessDay, we recognize the fight continues for many veterans.

The #2018FarmBill brings certainty and stability back to our agricultural community, giving them what they need to continue to put food on America’s tables. https://t.co/a45GOBmT1t -- #2018FarmBill maintains a commitment to rural America. It addresses the opioid crisis, strengthens rural broadband services &amp; establishes an U.S.-only vaccine bank. Nancy Pelosi is out of touch with rural states- the only interaction she\\'s had is at 35,000 feet in a private jet. https://t.co/WecYQYi6tP -- We enjoy the safest, most affordable and most abundant food source in the world, largely due to consistent investments in the agricultural innovation. The #2018FarmBill maintains funding for research, extension &amp; land grant universities &amp; specialty crops and organic research. https://t.co/ExJ4EMH68Q -- Despite Democrats claims, no child, caretaker of a young child, senior citizen or disabled person will lose SNAP benefits. New SNAP reforms ensure assistance for the vulnerable while giving work capable adults an opportunity to improve their life. https://t.co/MywjRplJou -- The #2018FarmBill provides real reforms to ensure that farmers keep providing the world with a safe and stable supply of food. Nancy Pelosi doesn’t agree but the only experience she’s had with rural America is flying over it in her private jet. #FlyOverNancy https://t.co/fK4HEFyXjw -- Mueller investigation is like a dog chasing its tail: There\\'s nothing to catch. 1 year &amp; millions of wasted tax $ later, he still has nothing on President Trump. This investigation needs to end. If anything, DOJ should be focusing on rooting out corruption within itself #LA95 -- Very glad we have a @USDA Secretary who really gets it! @SecretarySonny is doing a great job for our farmers. #LA05 https://t.co/0LFA4JsBxs -- Praying for a speeding recovery for our wonderful @FLOTUS, @MELANIATRUMP -- During #NationalPoliceWeek, we thank our LEOs for keeping our communities safe. #LA05 will celebrate our police officers all year since our Congressional Art Competition winner, Shelby Cumpton, honored her father &amp; state troopers w/ a portrait that will hang in the U.S. Capitol! https://t.co/MTwFy9U8A4 -- President Trump kept his promises by moving the embassy to Israel\\'s rightful capital, Jerusalem. This is a bold, courageous move shows that the US &amp; Israel are repairing the special relationship that was strained under Obama. The world is safer when our countries work together. -- While SNAP provides an important safety net for many Americans, I want it to be an on-ramp to success, not a lifestyle for work-capable adults. Changes to the SNAP program will help people break out of the cycle of poverty and climb the economic ladder. https://t.co/l9t2RFxJ4N -- In their own words, the #2018FarmBill gave @HouseDemocrats what they asked for. This proves their opposition is based entirely on politics. Let\\'s stop playing games and pass a long-term bill that gives our farmers the stability they need to feed this country! #LA05 https://t.co/SLLzNQs8Ng -- 3 American prisoners released from North Korea. If you haven\\'t noticed the incredible diplomatic work taking place on the Korean Peninsula under President Trump\\'s watch, it\\'s because you\\'re choosing not to give him any credit. #LA05 https://t.co/ejdymS77kP -- Pres. Trump made a wise decision to reimpose sanctions on Iran. Iran Deal was not deterrent to nuclear weapon; it was a pathway. The President has always put the security of the US &amp; our allies first and foremost above politics. Another example of solid, positive leadership #LA05 -- I joined the @LaFarmBureau Voice of Louisiana Agriculture podcast to discuss policies in the Farm Bill, including important changes to help #Louisiana commodity producers. #LA05\\n\\nhttps://t.co/pjTOZL7CPy -- It\\'s #TeacherAppreciationDay! I celebrate all the incredible teachers in #LA05! Good teachers  go above and beyond to provide support to children and their families, ensuring that every child has what they need to succeed. Make sure to say \"Thank You\" to a teacher today! https://t.co/DxlrKq43b2 -- May 3rd is the #NationalDayOfPrayer! Prayer is such a powerful tool to use in our spiritual life. \"Don\\'t be anxious but in every situation through prayer, petition &amp; thanksgiving, present your requests to God &amp; the peace of God will guard your heart &amp; mind in Christ.\" Phil 4:6-7 https://t.co/uqH1biebQd -- May is Military Appreciation Month. Having cosponsored 19 bills in Congress supporting the armed forces &amp; their families, I am always a committed voice for the military. For the month of May, let\\'s reflect on the sacrifice these men and women make every day for our country. #LA05 https://t.co/4odVqDANeI -- Israeli Prime Minister @netanyahu exposed what we\\'ve all suspected - Iran cannot be trusted and is pursuing means to deliver nuclear weapons. I hope President Trump tears up the current Iran Deal and renegotiates to find a solution that\\'s better for America and better for Israel. -- Today, #Louisiana celebrates its 206th birthday! Fun fact: Our state song, \"You Are My Sunshine,\" was written by Gov. Jimmie Davis, who grew up in Jackson Parish right here in #LA05. https://t.co/WRt0josk2T -- RT @westerncaucus: Great to be joined by @Interior @SecretaryZinke at today\\'s Member Meeting! As always, we had a lively discussion on impo… -- I call our farmers America\\'s \"thin green line\" because food security is national security. Passing the #2018FarmBill is critical to making sure we can continue to have a vibrant agriculture sector that keeps us fed. https://t.co/KlEYSaWbtm -- It’s never too early to teach them about #agriculture! Happy 5th birthday to my grandson, who wanted to play with farm animals at his party. #LA05 https://t.co/cm1lH1QSB6 -- Congrats to Kyle Duncan on his confirmation! He is exceptionally qualified and will do a terrific job as judge for the 5th Circuit Court of Appeal. https://t.co/Cg6k3RIixx -- Today kicks off National Parks Week. That means no entrance fees at any national park including #LA05\\'s own Poverty Point! #FindYourPark https://t.co/hr5KNJTLFg -- I attended a ceremony at @ArlingtonNatl Cemetery to dedicate the new #Vietnam Helicopter Pilots and Crew Member Monument for pilots like Eddie Schneider who risked it all for our nation. I am proud to be an original cosponsor of the bill that made this monument a reality. #LA05 https://t.co/CazrlMWyEw -- RT @HouseAgNews: #HouseAg Approves HR2 Agriculture &amp; Nutrition Act. @ConawayTX11: Today’s vote was about America’s farmers &amp; ranchers - abo… -- I was proud to work with my @HouseAgNews Committee colleagues to pass the #2018FarmBill out of committee. It is the single most important piece of legislation for our farmers, and I look forward to seeing it become law.

Work requirements/job training aren\\'t just GOP priorities; they\\'re what an overwhelming amount of Americans are calling for. #LA05 https://t.co/IX27rhuHEP -- The #FarmBill is the result of years of work. It will be better for the farmer and better for the American people. Today, we\\'ll pass it out of the @HouseAgNews Committee. Here\\'s a story from @TWILATV about how important this bill is to our young farmers and ranchers. #LA05 https://t.co/2ds8SNZzCL -- Dianne &amp; I join our nation in mourning Barbara Bush, a remarkable lady passionate about making our world better. She always told it like it was &amp; I admired that. She was a role model who showed courage, kindness &amp; humility. She was an American treasure, and we pray for her family -- I spoke with @KALBtv5 about how tax reform is working for Americans. This is the last Tax Day under our old, broken system. Next year, 82 percent of middle-income earners are expected to see a tax cut. #LA05 https://t.co/dyTDpUusWU -- Great meeting today with @TulaneNews President Mike Pitts. Enjoyed the update on some of the great research they\\'re doing back home in Louisiana. https://t.co/7cWNMzlBEO -- The #FarmBill offers long-term stability and certainty to our farmers and ranchers so that they can continue to produce the safest, most abundant food supply in the world. We\\'ll pass it out of the @HouseAgNews Committee tomorrow.\\nhttps://t.co/YibaPOf1Qp -- Steve Scalise is a great leader. Should he run for Speaker, the House will get a strong conservative at the helm, and Louisiana will have a very powerful ally.\\n\\nhttps://t.co/1USZ1PZNuX -- Tax Day is never fun but this is the last year you have to deal w/ old system. Thanks to #TaxCutsandJobsAct, next year you can file on a form as small as a postcard, double your standard deduction &amp; double your child tax credit. Tax reform is working for American families. #LA05 https://t.co/Y0YrWDuOzp -- Barbara Bush is a courageous lady who always faces life with full vigor. I hope her health improves, and I will continue to pray for her and her family. -- From @TownTalkDotCom about new SNAP work requirements: “It shouldn\\'t become a long-term solution. That may not feel like the most popular choice for politicians seeking votes, but it is what we believe is in the best interest of the people served.” #LA05 https://t.co/sCtTMGqwSb -- I fully support President Trump’s retaliatory strike. Syria committed atrocities against its own people and the Assad regime must realize that these actions will not go unanswered. I am supremely confident that the US and our allies have made the best decision possible. #LA05 -- RT @HouseAgNews: House Members from Across the Country Praise #2018FarmBill @CongressmanGT @RepBobGibbs @RepAbraham @RepHartzler @RepRickCr… -- No child, senior or mentally/physically disabled person will lose SNAP. Work-capable adults will be expected to work or train for a job, and we guarantee job training for all who want it. Why would Democrats oppose job training and helping people break free of poverty? #LA05 https://t.co/UgTA16y7Yz -- I cosponsored legislation calling for a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution. Unfortunately, it failed to reach the required 2/3 vote to pass. I will continue to support ways to cut waste, fraud and abuse and make government work smarter and more efficiently. #LA05 -- RT @LouisianaBar: LSBA representatives visited Wednesday with Louisiana\\'s Congressional Delegation (such as Representative Ralph Abraham, t… -- Great meeting today with Marshall Pierite, who was elected chairman of the Tunica-Biloxi Tribe of Louisiana on Sunday. Looking forward to working with you. #LA05 https://t.co/lfUbY0Li7d -- SNAP is an important safety net for many Americans, but I want it to be an on-ramp to success, not a lifestyle for work-capable adults. The new #FarmBill makes reasonable changes to work requirements so that more adults are ready for the workforce. #LA05 https://t.co/F6bwuoY04v -- Yesterday, I chaired a @HouseScience subcommittee hearing on Chinese spies infiltrating many layers of our society for nefarious reasons. China steals our fundamental research and quickly capitalizes by commercializing the technology. This must end. #LA05\\nhttps://t.co/8ieBVxQnsy -- On Holocaust Remembrance Day, #WeRemember those who lost their lives at the hands of Nazis and the strength of the survivors who\\'ve carried on. \"The one who does not remember history is bound to live through it again.\" - George Santayana https://t.co/pTNRe0wZMB -- RT @SteveScalise: A top digital strategist for the Obama campaign said Facebook allowed them to use data in ways others could not because t… -- RT @RepStefanik: ICYMI: The Margin Protection Program (MPP) is failing dairy farmers in my district. @RepAbraham and I sent a letter to Hou… -- .@OriginBank does a tremendous job, as evidenced by their continued expansion into new markets. Becoming a publicly traded company is just the latest sign of their growth, and I\\'m always proud when a company headquartered in North Louisiana thrives and succeeds. #LA05 https://t.co/MT14yiFr7j -- Today marks the beginning of Holocaust Days of Remembrance. Congress established these days to honor the resilience of survivors across the globe and to pay tribute to the millions of people who lost their lives during these atrocious acts. #WeRemember https://t.co/YAQagMvG5o -- China has unfairly targeted farmers with tariffs. I agree w/ President Trump that China must be held accountable for its deceitful trade practices, and I have asked the USDA to do all it can to support farmers during these trade negotiations. #LA05\\nhttps://t.co/UOdKAeTcQF -- \"To say there isn’t a move growing to repeal the Second Amendment is naive at best. And now one of Louisiana’s top Democrats has joined the movement to take away our rights to protect ourselves and our family.\" We can\\'t let that happen. #2A \\nhttps://t.co/1mhapf2bEf -- Greta Jones was a wonderful lady who cared deeply about making Louisiana a better place.

I\\'ll never support repealing the #2A, as some - including the head of the Louisiana Democratic Party - are now suggesting we do. The problem is the shooter, not the gun, and I\\'ll always defend our Constitutional right to bear arms. #LA05 https://t.co/phvTjqBY1g -- More from my interview with @KALBtv5 - The VA Choice Act is a great step, but we can do better delivering care to #Veterans. The choice for health care should always be up to the veteran, not the VA. #LA05 https://t.co/3v9RnzlJa1 -- We can never say \"Thank You!\" enough to our nation\\'s veterans. Today, we honor those who served in the Vietnam War as a reminder that their sacrifice is never forgotten. #NationalVietnamWarVeteransDay #LA05 https://t.co/auqvO5fjQA -- I spoke with @KALBtv5 about changes to #Census2020. We have to get a clear count of how many citizens we have and how many people are in this country illegally. Asking about citizenship is basic common sense and the #Census should include the question. #LA05 https://t.co/Y2u1jBfgPj -- It is common sense that the Census should ask whether a person is a citizen. American citizens deserve to know how much of their resources are being used by people who are here illegally and unlawfully benefiting from our social programs. #LA05 -- Here\\'s a great story about a CenLa resident, Htet Htet Rodgers, who beat the odds and became a powerful voice for the foster care system. Htet Htet shadowed me in Washington. She\\'s a terrific young lady, and we need more folks like her. #LA05 https://t.co/PePki10OVt -- I commend Attorney General @JeffLandry and his office for their due diligence in officially closing the book on the Alton Sterling case and upholding the rule of law. -- Today I spoke at the @LANationalGuard Youth Challenge graduation. This incredible program turns around young people’s lives &amp; helps pave their way for a brighter future. I’m proud of these graduates for completing this program &amp; I’m thankful for our soldiers who invested in them. https://t.co/3Ny4IhBlUK -- President Trump is considering a veto of the omnibus &amp; I hope he does veto it. Republicans should be using our majorities to have an open debate and write these spending bills to reflect our priorities - the military, the border wall, rooting out waste. #la05 -- (2/2) rather than focusing on the money our military and border security need. Dropping a $1.3 trillion spending bill - one that breaks a deal we struck just last month - hours before it needs to pass is an irresponsible way to govern, and that’s why I voted against it. -- (1/2) This 2,200 page omnibus dropped less than a day before we voted on it, and no one could possibly have read it all in that amount of time. I do know enough to see that it breaks budget compromise we struck last month by tacking on billions in extra spending on pet projects, -- An honor to accept the @AOPA Hartranft Award with my friend @RepRussell for leadership and advocacy on behalf of general aviation. Also recognized tonight was the one and only Harrison Ford for all the work he’s done to introduce children to the art of flying. #la05 https://t.co/Fp0MkIodEU -- I stand w/ @NIFLA &amp; #ProLife pregnancy centers that work hard everyday to help expecting mothers &amp; their babies. No one should be forced to advocate for abortion. California\\'s law is a clear violation of the Constitution and SCOTUS should strike it down. #GiveFreeSpeechLife #LA05 -- Thanks to @VP Mike Pence for speaking to young farmers today at the @USDA kickoff event to celebrate #NationalAgDay. It\\'s great to see an administration that values the contributions of rural America. #LA05 https://t.co/BGFX7Syi6C -- Enjoyed meeting with instructors from @LADeltaCC about the important role our community colleges and technical schools play in training tomorrow’s workforce. #la05 https://t.co/kpGStT7K4r -- CORRECTION: Congress shouldn\\'t* be involved in attempting to overturn trade decisions by the administration. -- Congress should be involved in attempting to overturn trade decisions by the administration.

The president continues to break glass ceilings at every level. Let us all continue to move this great country strongly forward. (2/2) -- A very bold &amp; positive move by Pres. Trump in appointing Mike Pompeo to the Sec. of State and Gina Haspel as CIA Director. Both will do great work in a very challenging environment.

This has always been about the Democrats trying to distract from the real issues. https://t.co/dmX9FwFqnw -- I signed onto this letter to have the #ConscienceProtectionAct included in the FY18 spending bill. It\\'s important legislation to protect the religious liberty of medical professionals who should not be coerced into performing abortions. #LA05 https://t.co/zlVHVVRQn7 -- Enjoyed spending part of the day in Bogalusa at Plainview Baptist Church celebrating the service of our Vietnam veterans. Your service is not forgotten and we can never thank you enough. #LA05 https://t.co/dA2P8fo85u -- I spoke w/ @KTBS news about how the budget bill that I supported will have a direct impact on our military families by providing them with the largest pay raise they\\'ve seen in 8 yrs.
