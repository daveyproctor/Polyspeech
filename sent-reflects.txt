How did you quickly tell if a word was positive or negative? Did you use any Python data structures? Were these similar to ones you had implemented more fundamentally in C?
We did not use a database of words, positive or negative. What would be the benefits of using one?
You probably chose not to cache (remember for future use) the results from each twitter query. What would be the benefits / costs of doing so?
Algorithms: Read over the "positive" and "negative" sentences generated by ./tweets on a certain username. Do these seem accurate? What types of phrases are being miscategorized? How might we complicate our algorithm to account for some of these errors.
Abstraction: Would you say there is repeated code between smile, `main` of tweets, and `search`? How might we abstract this code out?
